# Major Project Reflection

## What advice would I give myself?
- I would encorage myself to make more comments on what my functions and variables are doing 

## Was everything in needs to have completed?
- I completed everything in my needs to have and im satisfied with the results

## The hardest part?
- I often found myself battling with my own code due to lack of planning or having forgotten what my code is actually doing
- The hardest part was probably the inventory management and making items move from one inventory to another
- I also struggled with trying to move the inventory but that was moslty due to my incompetence not so much the difficulty of the task

## Were there any problems I could not solve?
- There were no problems that I could not solve
- There were things that I did not end up doing such as animation variety of crops and chests to hold items

## Things I am proud of
- I am very proud of the storage system 
- I am also proud of the pixel art that I did myself although I definitly wish it could of been better
- The sound effects and music i found and implemented within 20 min and I am very happy with how it turned out.
